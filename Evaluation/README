  This module serves the evaluation of the produced MRLs.
  The database respond to the system mrl is compared to the gold respond. Only indentical match is considered correct.														     
  For exact definition of used evaluation metrics see the presentation slides.												 
																	 
  IMPORTANT:                                                        
  1. The file "compare.sh" must be in the same folder.				
  2. This script can be used in both Python2 and Python3.			 
  3. The input files must contain the same amount of MRLs and       
 			have one MRL per line.									 
                                                                    
  For starting the evaluation the following is needed:	
  
     python2 evaluator.py system_mrl_file gold_mrl_file             
                                                                    
  The output will be displayed in the shell.
