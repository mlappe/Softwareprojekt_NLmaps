  This script implements a parser, that can check if an MRL is formed in accordance to the given rules.						
  The rules are extracted from a file "cfg.txt" which must appear in the same folder.									
																
  To begin you need to set up the parser:						
																
	import my_cfg_set as cfg									
	parser = cfg.EarleyParser()									
																
	grammar_file = "cfg.txt"									
	gr = cfg.Grammar(grammar_file) 								
	parser.set_grammar(gr)										
																
	output = parser.parse_mrl(mrl)								
																
  Afterwards, the variable output contains the truth value returned by the method. For more see the demo() 
	function at the very end of the script.
