This folder contains the Linearizer and Delinearizer Modules used for the SMT Model. Numbercodes are mapped to consonants to avoid
problems with the Alignment and decoded again with the Delinearizer. !NOT COMPATIBLE WITH NMT-MODEL--> LOOK AT oldLinearizer!

NOTE: Linearized and Stemmed data(for SMT) already ready for use in Linearized_Stemmed_Corpora.
